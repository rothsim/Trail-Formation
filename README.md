# MATLAB HS12 – Research Plan

> * Group Name: Slimy
> * Group participants names: Böttcher Lucas, Roth Simon, Schär Gabriela
> * Project Title: Trail formation with Physarum polycephalum

## General Introduction

Biologically inspired model of the Swiss railroad network depending on population growth. By using a biological (based on Physarum polycephalum) model, we want to simulate future scenarios of the Swiss railroad network. Probably a problem in future would be, that in fact of the urbanisation more people will use the public transport system. So we think it is necessary to simulate the main transport lines, to see where the system should be improved.

## The Model

(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abtraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)


## Fundamental Questions

(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
(Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )


## Expected Results

(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?)
