##Description

For a project related to the Chair of Sociology, in Particular of Modeling and Simulation of the ETH Zurich, we show in this first simulation the convergent behavior of the Physarum Polycephalum approach to the Swiss rail network inspired by a publication of Atsushi Tero et. al. (Physarum solver: A
biologically inspired method of road-network navigation). We show the map of Switzerland, where blue is not reachable terrain, red shows some urban agglomerations and the yellow parts the conductive nodes (transform to cyan if not used)
