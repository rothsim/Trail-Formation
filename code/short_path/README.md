# Shortest Path Manual

## Description
The Shortest Path function computes the minimal length between two points on a given grid. The program is optimized for the Slimy MATLAB computation output, to show that the path length in the Physarum simulation is minimal.

##PRE
* Map matrix A: coded as start: 2, free and end: 1, ghost 0 
* Neighborhood: neigh
* Points: start end matrix coordinates from points vector

##POST
* Matrix B: with drawn shortest path 
* short_length: shortest path length
